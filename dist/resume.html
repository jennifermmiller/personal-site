While I truly enjoyed the customer interaction and the feeling of helping others, I craved a more challenging work environment that would give me the opportunity to learn and grow on a daily basis. In my 12 weeks at the Iron Yard, I learned an incredible amount about front-end engineering and have acquired a strong love of coding. I am currently seeking an exciting opportunity to continue developing my skills. I'm willing to relocate for the right position.</p></section><section class=skills><h2>Skills</h2><p>Before attending the Iron Yard Academy, I knew next to nothing about front-end engineering. Wow! I learned a lot in 12 weeks! Take a look at my <a href=https://github.com/jennifermmiller/getInvolved>final project</a> where I put all of these newfound skills to use.</p><div class=skill><h3>HTML5/CSS3</h3><p>I can mark up any website design, pixel-perfect, and have experience with both cross-browser compatibility and creating responsive sites.</p><ul><li>Preprocessor Experience<ul><li>SASS/Compass</li></ul></li><li>Scaffolding/Workflow Tools<ul><li>Yeoman, Grunt, Bower</li></ul></li><li>Templating<ul><li>HTML5 Boilerplate</li><li>Twitter Bootstrap</li><li>Skeleton</li></ul></li><li>Cross-Browser Compatibility<ul><li>Modernizr</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class=skill><h3>Javascript</h3><p>I began my semester at The Iron Yard Academy with vanilla javascript.
